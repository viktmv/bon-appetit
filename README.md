## Bon Appetit

A food pick-up ordering app built for an icecream parlor but scalable to include multiple restaurants as a midterm project at Lighthouse Labs with a team of 3. The app allows a customer(user) to place an order and a restaurant to notify the user the status of their order via a dynamic order status page and text message notification.

* Front-end built using Bootstrap, Javascript, and HTML/CSS
* Backend was built using Node.js, Express, and PostreSQL
* Twilio API (modern telecomm API service) was used to allow text message or audio communication between the customer and restaurant

## Team Members:
* Dong Hu
* Viktor Tymofeev
* Karunvir Singh
